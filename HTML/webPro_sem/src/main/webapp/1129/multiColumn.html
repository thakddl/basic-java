  <h4>BTS - permission to danceBTS - permission to dance</h4>
  It's the thought of being young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Just sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we're just getting started
When the nights get colder
And the rhythms got you falling behind
<!-- Just dream about that moment -->
<!-- When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye -->
<!-- Then you say -->
<!-- I wanna dance, the music's got me going -->
<!-- Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah -->
<!-- Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden -->
<!-- And roll in like we're dancing fools -->
  </div>
